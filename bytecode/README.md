# Bytecode Examples

Several simple programs illustrating Java bytecode features. No executables, bytcode can be inspected by running `javap` or a similar tool for the classes created in `target/classes` when the project is build with `mvn compile`.

Examples are suitable to discuss the following features:

1. basic bytecode
2. invocations and field access
3. the constant pool
4. erasure
5. compilation of for loops
6. co-variant return types / bridge methods
7. synthetic fields to access instances of outer classes
8. reflection on synthetic fields
9. constant inlining and folding
