# The Visitor Pattern


## Iteration 1 -- nz.ac.vuw.jenz.visitor.iteration1 

This is the base line -- the package contains classes that can be used to define simple arithmetic terms such as `x+2`. 
It uses the Composite design pattern.

| Role      | Class(es) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Component   | `Term`       |
| Leaf        | `Variable` and `Constant` |
| Composite        | `ComplexTerm` |

The structure has been hard-coded, i.e. it hasn't been generated by a parser generator from a grammar. However, instances of those classes could easily represent a parse tree. 

## Iteration 2 -- nz.ac.vuw.jenz.visitor.iteration2

The model has been extended, now it can also represent expressions, such as `x+2=4`.

A visitor has been added to traverse expression trees. 


| Role      | Class(es) |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Expression   | ExpressionVisitor |

`IsGroundChecker` and `VariableFinder` are concrete visitors to illustrate how visitors work. They can be run using tests in `src/test/java`.

## Iteration 3 -- nz.ac.vuw.jenz.visitor.iteration3

Now the hierarchical visitor pattern is used, i.e. there are `visit` as well as `endVisit` methods. There is also a third implementation of this visitor `StructurePrinter`. The implementation of`IsGroundChecker` using hierarchical visitor is more efficient by avoiding unnecesary traversal.
