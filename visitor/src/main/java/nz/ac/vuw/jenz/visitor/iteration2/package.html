This package contains classes that can be used to define simple arithmetic expressions such as x+2=y . 
It uses the Composite design pattern as follows: <p/>

Component: Term<br/>
Leaf: both Variable and Constant<br/>
Composite: ComplexTerm<br/>
<p/>

In addition, the the visitor pattern is used to execute functions on the composite structure. <p/>

Visitor: ExpressionVisitor<br/>
Visitable: Expression<br/>
<p/>

The project also contains two concrete visitors, VariableFinder - a visitor that collects all variables, and IsGroundVisitor - a visitor to check whether an expression is ground in the sense of Prolog. 
There are two junit test cases Test1 and Test2 illustrating how to use the respective visitors.
