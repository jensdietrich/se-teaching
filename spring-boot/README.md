# Spring Boot Example 

To set up an example, use the spring [initializr](https://start.spring.io/) web app to create a project skeleton. 
This includes the pom.xml file with all dependencies needed.

In the [initializr](https://start.spring.io/) app, the build system (Maven vs Gradle), the programming language to be used (Java vs Kotin vs Groovy) and the spring version can be specified.
