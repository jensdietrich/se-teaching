# Generating a Parser with ANTLR

Using parser generators is a viable alternative to writing parsers by hand (a complex and error-prone task). Parser generators use a formal definition of a grammar, 
and generate code to parse and represent input complying to this grammar, for instance, by producing an AST that can be traversed and queried. 

A modern, widely used parser generator is [antlr](https://www.antlr.org/). Antlr can emit source code in various languages, including Java. In this example here, we use a (simplified) grammar of JSON to generate a parser, 
the grammar can be found in [src/main/antlr4/nz/ac/vuw/jenz/jsonparser/parser/JSON.g4](src/main/antlr4/nz/ac/vuw/jenz/jsonparser/parser/JSON.g4). 

Antlr is fully integrated into the Maven build through the use of the respective plugin, check `pom.xml` for details. When the project is build, antlr generates the parser source code in `target/generated-sources`. 
These sources are part of the classpath, and can be referenced by application classes within `src/main/java` . 

The sample application is a single class `nz.ac.vuw.jenz.jsonparser.JSON2XML` that parses a JSON document with nested arrays and objects, and transforms it into an XML document. This is done by implementing 
a `JSONListener` (this is an interface generated by the parser), the methods are callbacks invoked when the AST generated by the parser is traversed.

Note that the grammar is only a simplified version of JSON, it does not support special values like `true` and `false`, escaped characters and only allows a restriucted set of characters to be used in keys and values. 
Those simplifications have been made for readability. 

There is also an utility `nz.ac.vuw.jenz.jsonparser.VisualiseAST` to visualise the AST, further instructions can be found in the class docu.
