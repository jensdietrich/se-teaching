    This test intentionally excludes a root logger configuration. This is to demonstrate that by default, the root
    logger is configured as a Logger at the ERROR level with only a ConsoleAppender. Thus, the following would be
    implicit in a configuration that doesn't otherwise specify the root logger configuration:

    <Appenders>
      <Console name="Console">
        <PatternLayout pattern="{the default pattern}"/>
      </Console>
    </Appenders>

    <Loggers>
      <Root level="error">
        <AppenderRef ref="Console"/>
      </Root>
    </Loggers>

  <Loggers>
    <Logger name="sample" level="info" includeLocation="false">
      <AppenderRef ref="List"/>
    </Logger>
