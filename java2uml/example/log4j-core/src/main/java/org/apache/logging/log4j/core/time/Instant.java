/**
 * Models a point in time, suitable for event timestamps.
 * <p>
 * Provides methods for obtaining high precision time information similar to the
 * <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/9/docs/api/java/time/Instant.html">Instant</a> class introduced in Java 8,
 * while also supporting the legacy millisecond precision API.
 * </p><p>
 * Depending on the platform, time sources ({@link Clock} implementations) may produce high precision or millisecond
 * precision time values. At the same time, some time value consumers (for example timestamp formatters) may only be
 * able to consume time values of millisecond precision, while some others may require a high precision time value.
 * </p><p>
 * This class bridges these two time APIs.
