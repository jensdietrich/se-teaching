 * implementation of {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.AbstractManager} to handle external resources
 * such as streams, connections, and other shared state. As Appenders are plugins, concrete implementations need to
 * be annotated with {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.plugins.Plugin} and need to provide a static
 * factory method annotated with {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.config.plugins.PluginFactory}.
 *
 * <p>Most core plugins are written using a related Manager class that handle the actual task of serializing a
 * {@link LogEvent} to some output location. For instance, many Appenders can take
 * advantage of the {@link org.apache.logging.log4j.core.appender.OutputStreamManager} class.</p>
 *
 * <p>It is recommended that Appenders don't do any heavy lifting since there can be many instances of the class
 * being used at any given time. When resources require locking (e.g., through {@link java.nio.channels.FileLock}),
 * it is important to isolate synchronized code to prevent concurrency issues.</p>
