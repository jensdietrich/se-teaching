# Using a HttpClient library

The project does only contain a single test, no "actual code". In the test, we programmatically search google for 
*the answer to life the universe and everything*, and check whether *42* appears in the HTML page returned. Run this with `mvn test`.

If you feel lost, have a look at [this](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/42_(number)#The_Hitchhiker's_Guide_to_the_Galaxy).
